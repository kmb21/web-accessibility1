<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">This is the first of an ongoing series of articles that Language Magazine&nbsp;will be publishing to call attention&nbsp;to the importance of connections&nbsp;between language and enviroment</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">wo decades ago, I walked through the Siberian taiga with Marta Kongarayeva&nbsp;(born 1930), a lifelong huntress and&nbsp;forager, and one of the last speakers of Tofa.&nbsp;Having dwelled in the forest her entire life,&nbsp;Marta also inhabited a linguistic world that&nbsp;rendered it legible. She could name the most&nbsp;minute, yet meaningful, signs—tiny flowers&nbsp;blooming on the forest floor, insect chirps,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">28</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">lunar phases, patterns in lake ice, the creak of cedar cones disgorging their nuts. These&nbsp;signs spoke to Marta, telling her what day&nbsp;it was in the lunar calendar, what to gather,&nbsp;whereto hunt, and howto survive. And&nbsp;Marta spoke back to nature in her language,&nbsp;invoking the she-bearto fatten for the kill,&nbsp;offering tea and prayers to the campfire god&nbsp;for success in hunting, singing the wood&nbsp;grouse to the hunters snare, or serenading</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">a reindeer to nurse her calf. Martas lyrical dialogue with nature—which she knew to be&nbsp;capable of both benevolence and severity—&nbsp;was a spiritual practice that kept the world&nbsp;in balance and allowed her Tofa people to&nbsp;thrive in one of the harshest climes on earth.&nbsp;Martas Tofa language uniquely expresses&nbsp;&quot;I'll catch a quail&quot; as a single verb </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(uspullaar)&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and &quot;my two-year-old male castrated domesticated rideable reindeer&quot; as a single word</span></p><h5><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font0">March 2019</span></h5><div>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(■charym</span><span class="font0">). She could recite twenty Tofa words exclusively denoting body parts of a bear&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(irezang).</span><span class="font0"> Marta knew the name of each bend&nbsp;in the river, and directional words that applied only to rivers, and the names of water&nbsp;spirits. These language tools allowed her to&nbsp;skillfully wayfind through the forest, harvesting its bounty while respecting its pcwer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Without walking with Marta and listening to herwisdom, it would be hard to appreci-</span></p><h5><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font0">March 2019</span></h5>
<p><span class="font0">ate her linguistically encoded environmental knowledge (or LEEK, as I call it). Walking in&nbsp;the forest with an elder, you can witness how&nbsp;knowledge springs up from the land, trickles&nbsp;into the observant mind, and is absorbed by&nbsp;cultural practice. It can then be applied to&nbsp;sway nature to human will and to augur its&nbsp;patterns. This seems like magic to someone&nbsp;like me who comes from a culture thoroughly&nbsp;detached from nature and lacks the lexicon</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">languagemagazine.com</span></h4>
<p><span class="font0">of the forest. In fact, it is science, millennia of keen observation and cultural sense-making&nbsp;by astute, nature-attuned minds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Language infuses every environment. Through language, people generate and&nbsp;transmit astounding bodies of nature knowledge, mostly unwritten and stored only in&nbsp;memory. The application of this knowledge&nbsp;creates feedback loops that link human perception and behaviorwith plants, animals,</span></p><h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font0">29</span></h5><div>

<p><span class="font0">and nonliving elements. How then can one practice environmental studies, ecology, or&nbsp;biological sciences without including and&nbsp;respecting the knowledge base found in&nbsp;the worlds 7,000 languages, and especially&nbsp;in smaller Indigenous tongues? Linguistic&nbsp;science has a role to play in understanding&nbsp;climate change, biodiversity, conservation,&nbsp;and sustainability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But this is a different kind of linguistics than the one that has been ascendant in the&nbsp;academy for the past half century. Let's call it&nbsp;Environmental Linguistics, a re-attachment of&nbsp;language to nature. For Indigenous peoples,&nbsp;these two were never parted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">I went to Siberia to do field linguistics, planning to compile a grammar, dictionary,&nbsp;and text collection of Tofa. Grammar, so we&nbsp;are taught in contemporary linguistics, may&nbsp;be extracted from speakers' minds, captured&nbsp;in recordings, and analyzed for science. But&nbsp;on my walks with Marta, I came to appreciate how her language did not exist apart</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">from her people's forest habitat. Tofa would make little sense in a library in New York or&nbsp;a digital archive in the Netherlands—or in&nbsp;Stalinist gulags where Varvara Adamova and&nbsp;others had been exiled just for speaking it&nbsp;(</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">youtubexom/enduringvoices</span><span class="font0">). The intimate&nbsp;environmental knowledge Tofa encodes is&nbsp;nonportable, largely untranslatable, and&nbsp;exists nowhere else on the planet, nor in the&nbsp;minds of any other people. Although I had&nbsp;analytical tools from linguistics and anthropology, these had not prepared me to grasp&nbsp;the complexity, connectedness, and value&nbsp;Tofa holds for its speakers.</span></p><h6><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">A language hotspot</span></h6>
<p><span class="font0">Recently, I have continued exploring the language-environment interface in the South&nbsp;Pacific, a place remarkably different from&nbsp;Siberia. Vanuatu's lush tropical islands are&nbsp;home to a self-confident people enjoying the&nbsp;bounty of the sea while managing tourism&nbsp;that showcases their pristine coral reefs and</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">daring land-divers. Vanuatu boasts astonishing species diversity. It is also the world's leading &quot;Language Hotspot&quot; (a term I coined&nbsp;in 2007 for the National Geographic Society&nbsp;to help visualize global patterns of language&nbsp;diversity). The Ni-Vanuatu people—with a&nbsp;population of just 250,000—boast the highest ratio of languages to people anywhere&nbsp;on earth. They express themselves in one&nbsp;of 113 local tongues, as well as Bislama,&nbsp;French, and English, and many speak several&nbsp;of these languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On Futuna Island, I met Anselon Seru, in his mid-20s and renowned for his fishing&nbsp;expertise. Showing off a prized tuna (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">warkag</span><span class="font0">-</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ho)</span><span class="font0"> he had netted from his wooden outrigger&nbsp;canoe </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(waka),</span><span class="font0"> Anselon paused to photograph it and upload the image to Instagram.&nbsp;When I turned on my recorder, Anselon&nbsp;readily named more than 250 species offish&nbsp;and described their feeding habits, migration&nbsp;patterns, and schooling formations. Many&nbsp;Futuna fish names do not map one-to-one</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div><h5><span class="font0">30</span></h5></div><br clear="all"/><div><h4><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">languagemagazine.com</span></h4></div><br clear="all"/><div><h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font0">March 2019</span></h5></div><br clear="all"/><h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font3">language);</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">onto the Linnaean scientific taxonomy used by marine biologists. Rather, the Futuna&nbsp;apply a cultural logic of classification and&nbsp;naming that they find apt. For example,&nbsp;two fish that appear identical to a marine&nbsp;biologist and share just one scientific name&nbsp;are named as two distinct species in Futuna,&nbsp;because one rests in the daytime and the&nbsp;other at night. To fish, one must also sail, and&nbsp;so I listened as expert navigatorYaugane&nbsp;Misikofe taught the young men the names&nbsp;of 18 winds that make up the Futuna wind&nbsp;compass, a crucial tool for making landfall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On nearby Aneityum island, elder David Nasauman explained the sugarcane&nbsp;calendar, each month named fora different&nbsp;cane variety. Davids son, Wopa Nasauman,&nbsp;named the dozen plant species he had&nbsp;turned into rope, thatch, and posts to build&nbsp;his cyclone house. Martial Wahe explained&nbsp;the eight life stages of the coconut, and&nbsp;Ruben Neriam named thousands of plants.</span></p><div><img src="Harrison-David_files/Harrison-David-5.jpg" style="width:12pt;height:28pt;"/></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">many with curative properties. As part of a five-year project called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Plants mo pipol&nbsp;blong Vanuatu</span><span class="font0"> (Plants and People of Vanuatu), I am working with the Vanuatu Forestry&nbsp;Department and with New York Botanical&nbsp;Garden scientists Michael Balickand Gregory&nbsp;Plunkett.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The foundation for our scientific work is the knowledge base of the Vanuatu people, which they have generously shared yet&nbsp;retain as their own intellectual property. As&nbsp;botanists collect specimens of more than&nbsp;2,000 plants entirely new to modern science,&nbsp;we find almost every one to be well known,&nbsp;named, and used by local people. As Takaro-ga Kuautonga of Futuna Island remarked:&nbsp;&quot;We have names for all these plants in our&nbsp;la nguage.&quot;</span></p><h6><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Technologizing the word</span></h6>

Eager technologizers, they are crossing the digital&nbsp;divide and creating an online presence for&nbsp;tongues never before heard outside a few&nbsp;isolated villages. They do this intentionally,&nbsp;viewing technology not as a threat but an&nbsp;opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By leveraging the positive value of globalization, they visibilize their cultures, inviting the appreciation of a global audience.</span></p><h6><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Owning your language</span></h6>
<p><span class="font0">Languages are endangered because they have been conquered, colonized, and&nbsp;oppressed and are now dominated by major&nbsp;global tongues. Tofa is nearing a vanishing&nbsp;point, with a dozen elderly speakers left. As&nbsp;Marta Kongarayeva told me: &quot;Old age is&nbsp;creeping up on me, and soon I'll go&nbsp;berry-picking. When I go, I'll take my language with me.&quot; Futuna counts over 1,000&nbsp;speakers but is potentially threatened as</span></p><h6><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Clifton Napopo (left) and Nigasau Misikofo (right) draw a wind compass map on Futuna Island, Vanuatu.</span></h6><div><img src="Harrison-David_files/Harrison-David-6.jpg" style="width:542pt;height:426pt;"/>

<p><span class="font0">young people migrate off the island. Both scenarios are sources of concern met with&nbsp;active interventions by community leaders&nbsp;and by outsiders invited to assist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Speaking a heritage language can be an act of resistance and decolonization.&nbsp;Linguists must avoid recreating the colonial&nbsp;dynamic of exploitation and unequal power&nbsp;relations, and of treating languages as data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We should follow the lead of communities as they develop their own languages, fully accepting their ownership, authorship,&nbsp;and agency. Finally, we must diversify academic linguistics by training and equipping&nbsp;Indigenous scholars invested in the survival&nbsp;of their languages.</span></p><h6><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Hope amidst crisis</span></h6>
<p><span class="font0">The world is at a crucial juncture, as it stands to lose an immense portion of its plant,&nbsp;animal, and cultural diversity during this cen-</span></p><h5><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font0">32</span></h5>
<p><span class="font0">tury. Threats to the natural environment are largely driven by climate change and unsustainable lifestyles. Languages are falling into&nbsp;forgetfulness, disuse, and oblivion as major&nbsp;global languages expand to dominate human thought and discourse. Saving species&nbsp;from extinction, adapting to climate change,&nbsp;and assisting communities in revitalizing their&nbsp;languages are urgent, intertwined efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As Neil McKenzie of the Yawuru people of Australia explained to me while demonstrating howto find water and edible plants in his&nbsp;ancestral territory, &quot;If I don't show you the&nbsp;land, you won't understand the language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It exists because of the land. It is in close harmony with it.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A sign of hope that we may yet learn to create a sustainable civilization is that&nbsp;humans have done so before, many times&nbsp;over: the Yawuru in their desert landscape,&nbsp;theTofa in the Siberian wilds, and the Ni-</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">languagemagazine.com</span></h4>
<p><span class="font0">Vanuatu on their bountiful islands. These Environmental Linguists are willing to teach&nbsp;us, if we are willing to listen.
